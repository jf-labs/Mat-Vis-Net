# Material Visual Network

**SurfaceSense** is a deep-learning–based visual recognition engine designed to identify and compare flooring and decorative materials by **brand, collection, color tone, finish, and material type**.  
It powers intelligent search and recommendation use cases for flooring retailers by understanding how similar two materials *look and feel*.

## 🔍 Overview

Traditional image classifiers can label a surface as *wood* or *tile*, but real-world flooring decisions require finer understanding:
- Is this a **wood-look porcelain tile** or **true oak plank**?
- Is the finish **matte** or **polished**?
- Which products are **visually closest** to the one shown?

This Material Visual Network tackles these questions by combining:
- **Transfer learning** for robust visual feature extraction.  
- **Deep metric learning** for similarity search and clustering.  
- **Multi-label classification** for attributes such as brand, tone, and finish.
